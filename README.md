# Symbolic elimination performance profiles
Code for reproducing performance profile of the symbolic elimination schemes for dynamic optimization proposed in the two (as of yet unpublished) references below. The code depends on JModelica.org. At the time of writing, the code is compatible with revision [9203](https://svn.jmodelica.org/trunk/?p=9203) of JModelica.org. Significantly older or newer revisions are unlikely to be compatible without modification.
